## MyTools
A module for different tools I find myself constantly wanting to use

This module includes a few tools which I commonly find myself needing. These tools include the following:
- timing tools: wrappers to time different methods. Useful when testing alternate implementations for performance.
- memory profiling tools: allows for memory performance analysis to optomize code for memory performance.
- Others coming soon ...
